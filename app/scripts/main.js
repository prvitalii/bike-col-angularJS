In fact, nearly every single piece of it was redesigned from the ground up, with every facet examined. And the result is a bike with supreme braking and a 116-second advantage, compared to the Tarmac SL5, over 40km.",

Not the adrenaline kind, but more of the quad-searing variety. And while we're all for getting a hard workout in, it's nice to have some extra power, and there's only one bike that allows you to do that without sacrificing big suspension travelâ€”the Turbo Kenevo Expert 27.5.",

That's because we wanted to be sure that we designed a bike that best meets your needs. With our lives getting more hectic with each passing day, after all, finding the littlest time savings can have a huge impact, and the 6.0 truly embodies this concept. It utilizes our most advanced pedal-assist technologies, a high-quality component spec, and a suspension fork to take the edge out of those pesky potholes. No matter where you're going, get there fast and in style with the Turbo Vado 6.0.",
